# this is give wanna study how to create in to discord bot a repositories

## How to do it
you need install python 3.1.1 or python higher version

### 1.
before starting formal teaching, first prepare the environment you need to write

i personally recommend Visual studio code (Vscode)

followed by Microsoft visual studio (Msc)

### 2.
you need to create a virtual environment in your terminal

how to create?

use this commands
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
in the .venv you can change like a name

then you will see a folder called .venv appear in your folder

don't worry, that's the folder you created

### 3.
before officially writing your discord bot, make sure you have entered the virtual environment

use this commands
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate 
```

now you can check the path of your folder to see if there is (.venv)

if not, check to see if your folder path is correct
### 4.
for code writing after that, you can copy the python code in this repositories. More codes in different languages ​​will be added later

## Good bye
